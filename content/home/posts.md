The conference is organized by the Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG) initiative, and builds on the MD4SG workshop series and tutorials at conferences including ACM EC, ACM COMPASS, and WINE. EAAMO â€™21 will feature keynote presentations and panels and contributed presentations on research papers, surveys, problem pitches, datasets, and software demonstrations. In line with the MD4SG core values of bridging research and practice, the conference aims to provide an international forum for researchers as well as policy-makers and practitioners in various government and non-government organizations, community organizations, and industry to build interdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder research pipelines.
