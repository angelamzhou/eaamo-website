EAAMO 2021 will be organized as a virtual-only conference. Details of the virtual conference format are described below. To determine this format, we have been inspired by good practices and experiences in many other conferences. Our guiding principles are:

* The interactive nature of a conference is to be preserved as much as possible.
* We foster sharing of ideas and encourage cooperation between researchers and practitioners.
* Sessions are kept sufficiently short to avoid fatigue and concentration loss, with frequent (small) breaks.
* Parallel sessions are avoided.
* The live meetings and social events are aimed to be engaging, dynamic, and as interactive as possible.

EAAMO '21 will use Zoom meetings for keynote talks, panel discussions, and live sessions, and Gather.town for all other activities.

# Conference Program

The inaugural EAAMO ‘21 will take place on **October 5-9, 2021**, virtually, on Zoom and Gather.town, with the following program.

Please note that this is a **preliminary conference program** and that slight alterations are possible. Note that ET stands for current "New York, USA" time. Please find **Google Calendar** below the conference program. Feel free to subscribe to the calendar.

    		<p>By the end of 2020, more than 80 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced. In this panel discussion, we hear from diverse group of practitioners who have experience working with refugees and asylees.</p>
			<p>Our panel includes:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Yeukai Chideya</b>, a social worker with eight years experience at the Trauma Centre for Survivors of Violence and Torture in Cape Town, South Africa. Many of the clients of the Trauma Centre are refugees.</li>
			<li><b>Richard Thickpenny</b>, who leads strategic innovation at ACH Refugee Integration, working with resettled refugees and migrants mainly in the west of England.</li>
			<li><b>Paulina Vera</b>, a lawyer who provides legal representation to asylum-seekers and respondents facing deportation in Immigration Court. She previously served as the only Immigration Staff Attorney at the Maryland-based non-profit, CASA.</li>
			<li><b>Alicia Wrenn</b>, who leads the U.S. portfolio of programs for refugees and asylees at HIAS, an NGO which has provided assistance to refugees for over 100 years.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The aim of the panel discussion is to gain insight into the panelists' work, their careers in the civic sector, the main challenges they face, and how to bridge the gap between research and practice. We will get insight on common misconceptions about refugees and asylees, what the panelists think researchers could learn from their experience, and what changes the panel think could most improve the lives of refugees and asylees.</p>
