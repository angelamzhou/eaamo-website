# Policy & Practice sessions: call for interest from practictioners

As the conferenceâ€™s mission is to bridge research and practice, the conference will host three Policy and Practice sessions where researchers can connect with invited policymakers and practitioners who work directly with underserved and disadvantaged communities. 

During the first half of each session, the policymakers and practitioners will participate in a panel discussion to gain insight into their work, how to build a career in their sector, the main challenges they face, and how to bridge the gap between research and practice. 

In the second half of each session, the policymakers and practitioners will split into separate breakout rooms where conference attendees can ask follow-up questions.

In addition to the invited sessions, we welcome all policymakers and practitioners to attend the conference for free. With the aim of sparking collaborations, we will connect policymakers and practitioners with researchers attending the conference.
