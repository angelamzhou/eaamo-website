# Gather Login and General Information

The main conference is happening on the Gather.town platform and Zoom. Gather.town provides a 2d layout in which participants can navigate an avatar using the arrow keys. When a group of avatars are in close proximity, a video conference is started. Members of such a group can also share screen to, e.g., go over slides from the talks. The following is a brief guide to the experience.

## Gather Guide

We strongly recommend that you give yourself at least a 30 minute margin to enter Gather for the first time. There can be last minute issues when entering the platform, and this way you can ensure you won't miss any workshop events/presentations. Please see [this short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx15vYO-IMk) on setting up Gather and navigating on the platform.
