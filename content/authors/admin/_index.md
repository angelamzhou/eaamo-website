<!--The inaugural ACM conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization aims to highlight work where techniques from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design can be useful in welding research pipelines together with the social sciences in helping improve access to opportunity for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities. The conference is part of the [Mechanism Design for Social Good](http://md4sg.com/) initiative, building on the success of the MD4SG [workshop series](http://md4sg.com/workshop/EC19/cfp.html), tutorials at ACM EC, ACM COMPASS and WINE, as well as numerous online activities including [working groups](http://md4sg.com/workinggroups/index.html) and an [online colloquium series](http://md4sg.com/colloquium/index.html). -->

The inaugural ACM conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO ’21) aims to highlight work where techniques from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from other disciplines, can help improve equity and access to opportunity for historically disadvantaged and underserved communities. The conference is organized by the [Mechanism Design for Social Good](http://md4sg.com/) (MD4SG) initiative, and builds on the MD4SG [workshop series](http://md4sg.com/workshop/EC19/cfp.html) and tutorials at conferences including ACM EC, ACM COMPASS, and WINE. <!-- EAAMO ’21 will feature keynote presentations and panels and contributed presentations on research papers, surveys, problem pitches, datasets, and software demonstrations. --> In line with the MD4SG core values of bridging research and practice, the conference aims to provide an international forum for researchers as well as policy-makers and practitioners in various government and non-government organizations, community organizations, and industry to build interdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder research pipelines.
