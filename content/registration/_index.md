# Registration information

More details about how to register for the conference will be announced soon.

## Registration Waivers and Data Plans
 
The conference will provide a number of need-based grants to subsidize the costs of registration as well as provide additional financial assistance to procure data plans for attending the conference. Preference will be given to individuals who have submitted papers to the conference. We especially encourage those from underrepresented communities and institutions to submit a financial assistance application. 

We will provide two kinds of assistance:

- Waiver of 10 USD registration fee.
- Paid data plan top-ups for virtual attendance.

Please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/AP9nmLStPzHSrqMv7) if you require financial assistance, specifying what kind of assistance you are requiring. **All financial assistance applications must be submitted by June 3rd, 2020 at 9 PM ET**; applications received after this date will not be considered.
