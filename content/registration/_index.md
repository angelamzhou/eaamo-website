## Call for interest from practitioners

A main goal of the conference is to bridge research and practice. The program committee is seeking interest from practitioners working at non-profits and in government to attend the conference. All invited practitioners can attend free of charge and will be integrated into the conference program to connect with researchers. 

You are welcome to signal your interest or nominate someone else in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc38RtZFP8pqm3r7DzpAPYRarDhDzUVLWWifIGERzDh79zsNA/viewform).

## Registration Waivers and Data Plans
 
The conference will provide a number of need-based grants to subsidize the costs of registration as well as provide additional financial assistance to procure data plans for attending the conference. Preference will be given to individuals who have submitted papers to the conference. We especially encourage those from underrepresented communities and institutions to submit a financial assistance application. The deadline for applying for registration waivers and data plans is **September 10, 2021, 5 PM GMT.**

We will provide two kinds of assistance:

- Waiver of the registration fee.
- Paid data plan top-ups for virtual attendance.

Please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/AP9nmLStPzHSrqMv7) if you require financial assistance, specifying what kind of assistance you are requiring. Upon approval, you will receive a promo code to register for free on [Eventbrite](https://eaamo21.eventbrite.com).
