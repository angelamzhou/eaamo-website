The inaugural **Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization** (EAAMO â€˜21) will take place on October 5-8, 2021, virtually, on Zoom and Gather.town.
 
The goal of this event is to highlight work where techniques from algorithms, optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from the social sciences and humanistic studies, can improve access to opportunity for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities. 
 
The conference aims to foster a multi-disciplinary community, facilitating interactions between academia, industry, and the public and voluntary sectors. To this end, it takes a broad view of how research can contribute to access to opportunity, and welcomes work from along all stages of the research-to-practice pipeline. This also includes work that surfaces novel insights into the workings of social systems. The program will feature keynote presentations from researchers and practitioners as well as contributed presentations in the research and policy & practice tracks. 
 
We solicit submissions in the **research track** and **policy and practice track**. Submissions can include research, survey, and position papers as well as problem- and practice-driven submissions by academics from any discipline and practitioners from any sector. For more details on submitting to each track, please visit each track's page: 

- [Research Track](https://eaamo.org/cfp/cfpresearch/) call for participation
- [Policy & Practice Track](https://eaamo.org/cfpolicyandpractice/) call for participation

We encourage submissions from across various disciplines and covering domains including civic participation, data economies, discrimination and bias, economic inequality, economic development, education, environment and climate, healthcare, housing, labor markets, and law and policy. Papers will be peer-reviewed by experts in the disciplinary area. The deadline for submissions is <span style="color:red">**June 3rd, 2021, 9pm ET**.</span>

*ACM EAAMO is part of the Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG) initiative, and builds on the MD4SG technical workshop series and tutorials at conferences including ACM EC, ACM COMPASS, ACM FAccT, and WINE.*
