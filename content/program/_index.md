## General Guidelines
EAAMO 2021 will be organized as a virtual-only conference.

Details of the virtual conference format are described below. To determine this format, we have been inspired by good practices and experiences in many other conferences ([ACM FAccT](https://facctconference.org/) and [ACM EC](https://ec21.sigecom.org/)).

## Virtual conference format

Guiding principles:

* The interactive nature of a conference is to be preserved as much as possible.
* We foster sharing of ideas and encourage cooperation between researchers and practitioners.
* Sessions are kept sufficiently short to avoid fatigue and concentration loss, with frequent (small) breaks.
* Parallel sessions are avoided.
* The live meetings and social events are aimed to be engaging, dynamic, and as interactive as possible.

## Tools used

* **Zoom meetings** are used for keynote speeches, panel discussions, and live sessions. To diminish the risk of Zoom "bombing" and Zoom crashing, the conference organizers will restrict access only to registered users.
* **Gather.town** is a web-conferencing software with the added component of seeing the virtual “room” you and others are occupying, and with the ability to move around and interact with other participants based on your locations in the room, just like real life.

# Conference Program

The inaugural EAAMO ‘21 will take place on **October 5-9, 2021**, virtually, on Zoom and Gather.town, with the following program.

Please note that this is a **preliminary conference program** and that slight alterations are possible. Note that ET stands for current "New York, USA" time.
