## Panel Discussion: "Insights on Working with Refugees and Asylees"

**October 7 (Thursday) 12:15 - 13:15 (ET)**

By the end of 2020, [more than 80 million people](https://www.unhcr.org/en-au/figures-at-a-glance.html) worldwide were forcibly displaced. In this panel discussion, we hear from diverse group of practitioners who have experience working with refugees and asylees.

Our panel includes:
- [Yeukai Chideya](#yeukai-chideya), a social worker with eight years experience at the Trauma Centre for Survivors of Violence and Torture in Cape Town, South Africa. Many of the clients of the Trauma Centre are refugees.
- [Richard Thickpenny](#richard-thickpenny), who leads strategic innovation at ACH Refugee Integration, working with resettled refugees and migrants mainly in the west of England.
- [Paulina Vera](#paulina-vera), a lawyer who provides legal representation to asylum-seekers and respondents facing deportation in Immigration Court. She previously served as the only Immigration Staff Attorney at the Maryland-based non-profit, CASA.
- [Alicia Wrenn](#alicia-wrenn), who leads the U.S. portfolio of programs for refugees and asylees at HIAS, an NGO which has provided assistance to refugees for over 100 years.

The aim of the panel discussion is to gain insight into the panelists' work, their careers in the civic sector, the main challenges they face, and how to bridge the gap between research and practice. We will get insight on common misconceptions about refugees and asylees, what the panelists think researchers could learn from their experience, and what changes the panel think could most improve the lives of refugees and asylees.
