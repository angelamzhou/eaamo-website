<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> Data for Service </h3> </div>

<p>Abstract: Digital platforms commonly neither buy nor sell information direction, but rather indirectly. Namely, the trade in individual and social data is bundled with goods and services. For example, a search engine sells information about the searcher together with a query via sponsored search auction. A social network matches advertisers and individual consumers with certain characteristics. As a consequence, digital platforms typically do not compensate individual consumers directly for their information, but rather provide services whose benefits are naturally increasing in the amounts of information they generate. We investigate to what extent the barter of information for service leads to efficient and fair trade in online data markets.</p>

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> Fairness in Social Choice and Public Resource Allocation </h3> </div>

<p>Abstract: Fairness has been an important criterion in social choice since its inception, both as an epistemic concept (i.e. fairness in terms of the outcome), and in terms of participants having an equitable voice.  We will describe a practical deployment that brings issues of equitable voice to the fore, and then present a stylized approach for fair outcomes in public decision making. On the practical side, we discuss a feedback process we ran on behalf of the city of Austin in the spring of 2020. The George Floyd protests happened in the middle of the process, resulting in a dramatic increase in public interest in the feedback process, and a shift in the nature of the feedback. The stylized theoretical  result involves achieving fair outcomes in public decision making via reduction to a public goods market. We claim that bridging the gap between the normative issues that we discuss and the kind of stylized models we can analyze is one of the most important problems in social choice. This represents joint work with Yiling Chen, Nikhil Garg, Lodewijk Gelauff, and Benjamin Plaut.</p>

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> More than Fair: How to Bring Communities, Computer Science, and the Social Sciences Together to Build for Social Justice </h3> </div>

<p>Abstract: Data and technological innovations are meant to make life easier—to help us optimize the speed of decision-making and create efficiencies that amplify our impact. In the world of community health, this impact can mean life or death. And, as the pandemic has shown us, technologies built without engaging communities or narrowly focused on what those in power want generates more work and inequity in the process. Drawing on principles eloquently articulated in 2020 by scholar Sasha Costanza-Chock in Design Justice, this talk will share research insights from a 6-month study of community-based organizations (CBOs) in North Carolina serving marginalized Black and Latinx communities across the State. This coalition of CBOs operates as a grassroots extension of public health and have become pivotal conduits for COVID-19 health information and education, access to food, shelter, and equitable vaccine access. This keynote will discuss the promises and challenges of bringing industry engineers, social scientists, and this CBO coalition to the table to develop open-source software to CBO needs with justice, rather than efficiency, as the North Star. The talk will open with considering how unexamined investments in measuring bias and fairness in training data or computing systems distract us from what difference it might make to collect data and develop tech with rather than for communities. The talk then shares the research team’s methodologies and frameworks for balancing the demands of collecting community members’ health data with efforts to create a new mechanism for CBOs to cost share serving as community data trusts. While one aspect of the study was to understand what a better electronic intake form might look like for CBOs that, typically, lack the resources to buy—let alone build and maintain—sophisticated software or data management systems, the larger focus of the research is to explore what it means to truly build with, rather than for, community groups and societal resilience more broadly. Specifically, what does it mean to focus deeply on social interactions that are computationally hard to see or measure but qualitatively invaluable and necessary to advance social justice? The talk will conclude with recommendations for how to reorient computer science to a more explicit theory and practice of power-sharing.</p>

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> Fairness in Multisided / Multistakeholder Online Platforms </h3> </div>

<p>Abstract: Algorithmic (data-driven) nudges are increasingly being used to help human decision makers on a variety of match-/market- making platforms from gig-economy and e-commerce platforms to online conferencing and charity platforms. A defining feature of these platforms is that they are multisided, i.e., the algorithms mediate interactions between multiple sets of stakeholders. Many existing notions of individual and group fairness in algorithmic fairness literature have largely been inspired by predictive risk assessment contexts (e.g., credit or recidivism risk assessments) that are often single sided. As such, these notions are insufficient to address difficult fairness considerations that arise when the mediating algorithm can trade-off beneficial outcomes for one side with those of the other side(s). In this talk, I will discuss the challenges we faced in our attempts to define and operationalize fairness notions in the context of a ride-sharing platform, an e-commerce platform and an online donations platform.</p>

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> Need vs. Merit: The Large Core of College Admissions Markets </h3> </div>

<p>Abstract: We study college admissions markets, where colleges offer multiple funding levels. Colleges wish to recruit the best-qualified students subject to budget and capacity constraints. Student-proposing deferred acceptance is stable and strategy-proof for students, but the set of stable allocations is large and the scope for manipulation by colleges is substantial, even in large markets. Under deferred acceptance, truthful colleges allocate funding based on merit. Successful manipulations consider applicants' outside options (specifically need) when allocating funding. In Hungary, where the centralized clearinghouse uses deferred acceptance, choosing another stable allocation would increase the number of admitted students by at least 3%.</p>

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> New Approaches to Public Policy Design in Education: The Thrust towards Inclusion, Quality and Justice in Mexico </h3> </div>

<p>Abstract: A Century ago, the emerging post-revolutionary Mexican State founded the Ministry of Public Education, an essential component of a national project centered on integrating a dispersed, diverse and illiterate population. Since, the Mexican System of Education, increasingly large and complex, has purported to provide access to all. Critical assessments have clearly shown that a thorough shift in educational policy making and implementation is needed if social justice is to be advanced. In this presentation, we argue that the recently redefined goals and objectives of public education provide an adequate framework to reinvent the system, redesign policy and, more importantly, create flexible and effective processes of implementation of interventions characterized by their sensitivity to diversity, spatial and social contexts as well as communities´ and individuals’ aspirations.</p>
